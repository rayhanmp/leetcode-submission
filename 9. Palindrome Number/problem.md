<p>Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.</p>

**Example 1:**
<pre>Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</pre>
